This site is a community, crowdsourced collection of code, tools, datasets, and other resources related to 
SafeGraph Data and the [Placekey Community](https://www.safegraph.com/covid-19-data-consortium). Thousands of organizations work with SafeGraph Data, and are contributing to COVID-19 data science research through the [Placekey Community](https://github.com/SafeGraphInc/awesome-safegraph-datascience#safegraph-data-consortium). We are leveraging the [awesome-list] approach to organize and share the rapidly growing set of contributions from this community.

**Please add to the list** :thumbsup: :chart_with_upwards_trend: **:**

Do you have a software tool, research project, use case, code snippet, or data product related to or using SafeGraph data, that you'd like to recommend or share? Please add it to the list using either:

1) a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with your items added to the list. This is so easy, you can [just edit the file directly in your browser](https://github.com/SafeGraphInc/awesome-safegraph-datascience/edit/master/README.md) and then click the "commit" button. 
or 
2) an [new issue](https://github.com/SafeGraphInc/awesome-safegraph-datascience/issues/new/choose) that includes details of what to add (link, description) and we will add it.
